## Lab 1: Intro to Jupyter and GitHub

This repository was created as part of the ITAI 2373 course lab session at Houston Community College. The lab covers:

- Setting up a GitHub account and exploring the GitHub interface
- Creating and managing a repository with version control
- Accessing and using Jupyter Notebooks via an online environment (Google Colab or AWS SageMaker Studio Lab)
- Creating a Jupyter Notebook with Markdown and Python code cells
- Running cells and observing output
- Saving, downloading, and uploading a notebook to GitHub

The notebook file `My_First_Notebook.ipynb` demonstrates basic Jupyter operations including a Markdown cell and a Python `print("Hello, World!")` code cell.
